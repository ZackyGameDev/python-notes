# Introduction
Python is an interpreted, high-level and general-purpose programming language. Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991, Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its notable use of significant whitespace. Its language constructs and object-oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear, logical code for small and large-scale projects

## How Code Executes in Python
Just like any other programming language, the code in python executes line by line, from left to right, that means, the code is read by the computer from left to right, and the code is executed one line at a time. Python is an **Interpreted** Programming language, and not **Compiled**, this means instead of converting the entire python code to machine code and then executing it, the code is converted to machine code line by line, and those lines are executed in real time. Because of this nature, you can also just open a python *shell* and execute python commands line by line in an interactive way, instead of having to write the whole thing as a code file.
